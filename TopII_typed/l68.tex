\begin{thrm}
Let $M$ be a compact connected orientable $n$-manifold. Then for all $x \in M$
and all coefficient groups $A$, the restriction map $r^M_x : H_n(M;A) \to
H_n(M|x;A) \cong A$ is an isomorphism.
\end{thrm}


\begin{proof}

\end{proof}

\begin{note}
The proof showed that the map $H_n(M;\Z) \otimes A \to H_n(M;A)$ from the
universal coefficient theorem is an isomorphism. Hence its cokernel
$\Tor(H_{n-1}(H;\Z), A)$ is zero for all abelian groups $A$. In particular, for
all $k \ge 1$, 
\[  k\text{-torsion in } H_{n-1}(M;\Z) \cong \Tor(H_{n-1}(M;\Z), \Z/k) = 0. \]
So the group $H_{n-1}(M;\Z)$ is torsion free for every compact, connected
orientable $n$-manifold $M$.
\end{note}

Next: "in mod-2 homology there are no orientability issues because $\F_2$ has
only one unit"

\begin{thrm}
Let $M$ be an $n$-manifold and $K$ a compact subset of $M$. Then there is a
unique class $\nu_K \in H_n(M|K; \F_2)$ such that for all $x \in K$, the class
$r^K_x(\mu_K)$ is non-zero, and hence a generator of $H_n(M|x;\F_2) \cong \F_2$.
\end{thrm}

\begin{corol}
Let $M$ be a compact connected $n$-manifold. Then for very $x \in M$ the map 
\[ r^M_x : H_n(M;\F_2) \to H_n(M|x;\F_2) \cong \F_2 \]
is an isomorphism. If $M \ne \emptyset$, then in particular $H_n(M;\F_2) \cong
\F_2$.
\end{corol}

\begin{proof}
Exactly as in the previous video for $\Z$-coefficients and orientable $M$.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
Let $M$ be a connected, compact, non-orientable manifold. Then $H_n(M;\Z) = 0$
by the previous video. The universal coefficient theorem provides and
isomorphism  
\[ \F_2 \cong H_n(M; \F_2) \congto \Tor(H_{n-1}(M;\Z), \F_2) = 2\text{-torsion
in } H_{n-1} (M;\Z). \]
\end{remark}
